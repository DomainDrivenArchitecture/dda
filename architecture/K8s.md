# Architecture for K8s

## Draft of idea
### Requirements
* a small k8s all in one system f√ºr serving one application.
* is compatible with k8s
* providing ingress for app to be installed (replacement of traditional reverse-proxy httpd)
* support letsencrypt (dynamic created by https) for a defined fqdn or injected static https certs.
* exposes dashboard with users defined & disabled annonymous access.

## Discussion

### What is the difference between roles and clusterroles?

### If we expose the Dashboard to the internet (which we want for control), is there more to do than just secure the login?

### How can we inject users for dashboard?

### How can users log in to the dashboard?
* Authorization: Bearer <token> header passed in every request to Dashboard. If present, login view will not be shown.
* Bearer Token that can be used on Dashboard login view.
* Username/password that can be used on Dashboard login view.
* Kubeconfig file that can be used on Dashboard login view.


### How can we deactivate default access to the dashboard? 
* Looking at: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#discovery-roles

### Is the API Server exposed to the internet in default settings? How can we deactivate that/deactivate anonymous user calls?

### How can we hand over certs ?
Inputs for Certs can be the letsencrypt controller pod or the static configured certs. How the app-ingress can use such a cert?

### How are secrets protected against pods ?

### How can we prevent pods from doing kubectl/api calls? (In general)
* Every pod has a service account, give it lower role?

### Which roles / actions are available on default k8s ?
