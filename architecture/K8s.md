# Architecture for K8s

## Draft of idea
### Requirements
* a small k8s all in one system f√ºr serving one application.
* is compatible with k8s
* providing ingress for app to be installed (replacement of traditional reverse-proxy httpd)
* support letsencrypt (dynamic created by https) for a defined fqdn or injected static https certs.
* exposes dashboard with users defined & disabled annonymous access.

## Discussion

### The default config for the microk8s is highly insecure and needs to be changed
* Starting point is default args given to the system services: https://github.com/ubuntu/microk8s/tree/master/microk8s-resources/default-args 
* We need to edit the respective files on the serverpath "/var/snap/microk8s/current" and restart microk8s 
* Another Starting point is changing the authorization mode of the api server: To activate RBAC replace "--authorization-mode=AlwaysAllow" with "--authorization-mode=RBAC" in line 5 of the file "/var/snap/microk8s/current/args/kube-apiserver"
* Default Service Account exists for alle Namespaces and pods take it when they dont have another account -> need to restrict it too 

### To secure the K8S Server we need to secure all the running pods and system services 
* https://github.com/ubuntu/microk8s
* each pod has the rights of its associated ServiceAccount
* to change the rights of a ServiceAccount we need to remove or add Cluster/Rolebindings: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/
* https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#discovery-roles -> seems to be no discovery role on microk8s

#### Securing the dashboard pod 
* [https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/wiki/Accessing-Dashboard---1.7.X-and-above](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/wiki/Accessing-Dashboard---1.7.X-and-above)
* Dashboard config for microk8s: https://github.com/ubuntu/microk8s/blob/master/microk8s-resources/actions/dashboard.yaml

##### How can users log in to the dashboard?
* Authorization: Bearer <token> header passed in every request to Dashboard. If present, login view will not be shown.
* Bearer Token that can be used on Dashboard login view.
* Username/password that can be used on Dashboard login view.
* Kubeconfig file that can be used on Dashboard login view.

##### How can we inject users for dashboard?
* one possibility is to create a new ServiceAccount, make the appropriate RoleBinding. A Bearer token is automatically created and can be used to login

##### How can we deactivate default access to the dashboard? 
* "Using Skip option will make Dashboard use privileges of Service Account used by Dashboard"
* Dashboard has no RoleBinding in microk8s, because all API calls are allowed by default
* After activating RBAC we need to make appropriate RoleBinding for the ServiceAccount -> just enough Permissions to be able to show the login screen and no more than that  

### How can we hand over certs ?
Inputs for Certs can be the letsencrypt controller pod or the static configured certs. How the app-ingress can use such a cert?

### How are secrets protected against pods ?

### Which roles / actions are available on default k8s ?
