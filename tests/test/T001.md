#calculate ttl

Remark: this can be stored somewhere in `clojure/test/resources/dda/controling/ttl-smeagol-test.edn`

```
some-kind-of-def-debts 
 {:salaries [{:recurrance :monthly
                  :name "me"
                  :amount 100.00}
                 {:recurrance :monthly
                  :name "myself"
                  :amount 100.00}
                 {:recurrance :monthly
                  :name "I"
                  :amount 100.00}]}
									```


Remark: We've to find somehow a good mapping to a test definition
